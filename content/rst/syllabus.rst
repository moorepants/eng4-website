Lecture 2 hours; laboratory 3 hours. Engineering design, descriptive geometry,
pictorial sketching, computer-aided graphics, and their application in the
solution of engineering problems.

This course is an introduction to engineering design and the related graphical
tools used to communicate design concepts. Topics include the following: visual
thinking, engineering design, free-hand sketching, projection theory, pictorial
sketching, solid modeling, engineering drawing standards, tolerancing,
plotting, and computer-aided design.

This course is designed to address three of the Mechanical and Aerospace
Engineering student outcomes:

- to prepare you to design a system, component, or process to meet desired
  needs within realistic constraints such as economic, environmental, social,
  political, ethical, health and safety, manufacturability, and sustainability
- to prepare you to communicate effectively
- to prepare you to use the techniques, skills, and modern engineering tools
  necessary for engineering practice

Goals:

- Introduction to engineering Design and its place in society
- Exposure to the visual aspects of engineering design
- Exposure to sketching and freehand drawing
- Exposure to engineering graphics standards
- Exposure to solid modeling
- Exposure to computer-aided geometric design
- Exposure to creating working drawings
- Introduction to projection theory
- Exposure to engineering communication

Office Hours
============

I will be available in my office during office hours (Tuesday and Thursday
1:00-2:00 PM, or by appointment) and via the smartsite chatroom, smartsite

Academic Integrity
==================

Academic dishonesty will not be tolerated. For your own enlightenment, please
visit the Academic Integrity web page from UC Davis Office of Student Judicial
Affairs at http://sja.ucdavis.edu/academic-integrity.html to review the campus'
policy on academic responsibility and integrity and read the UC Davis code of
academic conduct (http://sja.ucdavis.edu/cac.html).

Exams and midterms will be closed note, closed book and done on an individual
basis.

Feel free to discuss homework assignments and work on them together, but each
student must turn in a *unique* solution.

The TA's will set ground rules for working together on studio assignments. The
project will be a group effort with a single report for the entire group along
with peer evaluations.

Textbook
========

*Fundamentals of Graphics Communication*, Bertoline and Weibe, 6th Edition,
McGraw Hill Publishing. ISBN:978-0-07-352263-0 [`Book Info
<http://highered.mcgraw-hill.com/sites/0073522635/information_center_view0/>`_]

Both reading and homework will be assigned from the textbook. A copy of the
textbook will be available on two-hour reserve at the library. If you have an
older edition, I cannot guarantee that the homework problems or the content is
the same as the current edition. Find a friend to share the textbook with if
the price is prohibitive.

Supplies
========

Several drawing/sketching supplies will be helpful in your pencil and paper
work. All supplies are available from the campus bookstore at a discounted
price. You must purchase the required supplies before the first studio session
and bring at least the sketch pad to the first studio.

Required
--------

- Spiral Unlined Sketch Pad, at least 50 Sheets (9"x12" recommended)

Recommended
-----------

- Mechanical Pencil, 5 mm - HB lead
- 30/60 & 45 Triangles
- Black Felt Pen, Micro or Razor Point
- ~6” Protractor
- 12” Metal Metric/English Ruler
- Compass

Suggested
---------

- Divider (some compasses can be used as a divider)
- Circle Template (~1/16”-2”)
- 1 Gig (or more) USB memory stick (Cloud sevices like Dropbox_, `Google

Grades will be available in the smartsite.ucdavis.edu_ grade book periodically
throughout the course along with class statistics. Check the website on a
regular basis to gauge your performance. Keep in mind that **15% is deducted
per business day late** on all assignments. Take extra caution if you believe
your exams or assignments to be incorrectly graded. If the request for
additional points is found **NOT** to be valid, one point will be
**subtracted** from the total score of the assignment or exam.

================  ===  ==========
Studio            35%  Includes studio homework, in-studio projects, and quarter project

================  ===  ==========

.. _smartsite.ucdavis.edu: http://smartsite.ucdavis.edu

In class
   From time-to-time there will be in-class assignments which will count towards
   your lecture homework grade.
Lecture Homework
   Weekly homework will be assigned which will be due the before class the
   following week.
Sketchbook
   You are required to keep a design notebook (unlined sketchpad) for this course.
   Details on its use will be discussed in the first studio (lab) session. It will
   be collected a few times during the quarter and graded on consistent use and
   not on quality alone. Please number, date, and initial each page entry.
Studio
   Several in studio assignments will be given.
Studio HW
   The TA's may assign additional homework assigments in studio if necessary.
Project
   By the end of the studio sessions a group project will collected. Each group
   will be responsible for modeling and producing production drawings of a
   complex multi-component item. The project will be based on the quality of
   work and peer evaluations of teammates.

Smartsite
=========

We will make heavy use of smartsite for the course. Log in to
smartsite.ucdavis.edu with you Kerberos ID and passphrase then select **ENG 004
A01-A04 FQ 2012** or access the smartsite through this link:

https://smartsite.ucdavis.edu/xsl-portal/site/30860954-0d1c-4974-af70-db38f4ae42c6

We will be using several features in smartsite:

Announcements
   All class announcements will be sent to your UCD email address and be
   collected here. Check this regularly during the class for important
   information.
Assignments
   You will turn in some or all assignments through smartsite. If you have the
   ability to scan or take a clear photograph of your assignments, you can turn
   them in digitally. Otherwise they must be handed in at the beginning of
   class on the due date. Compress all of your files and documents into a
   single zip file with your name and section in the file name and attach it to
   the assignment. All documents must be in PDF form. Use Inventor's Pack and
   Go feature for inventor files.
Chat Room
   Feel free to use the chat room to meet with you peers and group members if
   you can't all be in one physical place. I will be available for chat during
   our scheduled office hours. The TAs may be available during studio sessions
   too.
Course Website
   This displays this website within smartsite.
Email Archive
   All emails sent to the class will be archived here. You may send emails to
   eng4-fall2012@smartsite.ucdavis.edu if you have general questions that all
   of the class may benefit from. **Do not abuse this.** Send personal emails
   to me and the TA's through our UCD email addresses.
Forums
   Feel free to start topics and discussion in the forums. All class
   participants and the instructors will be able to comment.
Gradebook
   You grades and basic stats on your relative performance will be available as
   the course goes along.
Mailtool
   This allows you to send emails to everyone or just the instructors. The same
   rules apply as in the "Email Archive" section.
Resources
   Files, documents, and other resources will be available here for download.
