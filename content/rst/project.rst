Project
=======

You will be assigned to a group in studio and will be required to submit a
design project

Requirements
------------

Project report
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Title page with project name, team member names, studio section day, TA
  name, date, and path to the location of model and assembly drawings, e.g.,
  ``...ENG4\ENG4-205\My Documents\Project\``, use Inventor's Pack and Go
  option.
- A table of contents
- Project summary

   - Describe the assembly that was modeled
   - Describe the individual parts that were modeled
   - Who modeled which part and the assembly

- A description of the modeling process, e.g. state the basic steps used to
  create the model.
- Difficulties you ran into (e.g. things you couldn't model, parts that took
  a long time, etc.) and your solutions
- Improvements to the model you would like to make and additional challenges
  you would like to explore given more time

Assembly drawing of entire model assembly
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Include a parts list and label all parts
- Label drawing with all group member names

One working drawing for each modeled part
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Label drawings with group member who created the model
- Label each part with a descriptive name and number it according to the
  assembly drawing parts list

A printout of the solid model from within Inventor
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Use transparency where appropriate to show maximum detail. This may also be
  used on your title page!

The project should be handed in as a complete report with the drawings and
printout as an appendix. Grades for the project will be done on a group basis
so be sure to proof each other's work.

Contact your TA in case they have additional requirements.

Projects are due by the end of your last Studio period. Submit your reports
directly to your TA.
