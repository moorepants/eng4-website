Project
=======

You will be assigned to a group of 3 or 4 in studio and will be tasked with
modeling a relatively complex mechanical assembly of your own choosing. The
project will be part reverse engineering and part design. You will collectively
select a product/machine/object that you think needs a design improvement.
Maybe you never want to open the lid of your trash can again and would like to
come up with an automatic opener or your desk needs adjustable legs for
standing and sitting. The design change to improve the object should be some
simple addition, we are not asking you redesign the whole thing. You will
ultimately model something that already exists but with something additional to
improve it just a little. Ideally, all of you should have access to this thing
so that you can see it, touch it, and measure it. The majority of your work
will be reverse engineering but some element of the assembly must be a new
design.

You will be required to submit a professional quality project report detailing
the modeling project and a team member evaluation.

The project should be handed in as a complete report with the drawings and
printout as an appendix in PDF format. Grades for the project will be done on a
group basis so be sure to proof each other's work.

Projects are due during the last studio period, 1 hour before the end of the
studio. Submit your reports directly to your TA. The final hour of the last
studio will be an informal presentation to show and describe your group's model
to the class. Have your model or images of your model on a USB stick so that
you can load them onto the main computer. Each teammate should describe
portions of the model that they worked on and what they learned while doing it.
This is an informal presentation, slides are not needed and everything should
be casual, just like a show and tell in elementary school.

Contact your TA in case they have additional requirements.

Requirements
------------

Everything below should be submitted in a single zip file.

Project report
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This report should be of professional quality and submitted as a single PDF
file with all graphics embedded and all working drawings included. The lab
computers have Abode Acrobat which will allow you to assemble any individual
PDF files together into one document.

- Title page with project name, team member names, studio section day, TA name,
  date, and path to the location of model and assembly drawings with in the zip
  file, e.g. ``...ENG4\ENG4-205\CoolProject\``.
- A table of contents
- Project summary

   - Describe the assembly that was modeled including the design improvement.
   - Describe the individual parts that were modeled.
   - Describe who modeled which parts, the assemblies, and the working
     drawings.
   - Describe how the team accomplished the project, how well you worked
     together, and what the teamwork taught you.

- A description of the modeling process, e.g. state the basic steps used to
  create the model.
- Difficulties you ran into (e.g. things you couldn't model, parts that took a
  long time, communication issues, team work load, etc.) and your solutions.
- Improvements to the model you would like to make and additional challenges
  you would like to explore given more time.

Solid model of the entire assembly
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This should include a collection of Inventor part and assembly files that make
up the entire object. Be sure to use Inventor's `Pack and Go`_ option. Make it
clear which assembly file is the main file with a clear name, e.g.
`Desk-Main.iam`.

.. _Pack and Go: packandgo.html

Assembly drawing of entire model assembly
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- This should be a working drawing with an exploded view. Make use of the
  presentation files to create this.
- Include a parts list and label all parts.
- Label drawing with all group member names.

One working drawing for each modeled part
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Label drawings with group member who created the model.
- Label each part with a descriptive name and number it according to the
  assembly drawing parts list.
- Include the most important dimensions for the reverse engineered portion and
  all of the dimensions for the added feature.

A printout of the solid model from within Inventor
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Save a aesthetically appealing image of your model. You can use the different
  view options to add shading, shadows, and different perspectives.
- Use transparency or multiple views where appropriate to show maximum detail.
  This may also be used on your title page!

Tentative Grading
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Summary: 10 pts
- Modeling Process Description: 5 pts

Sample Projects
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following images show some final screenshots of previous years' projects.
Keep in mind that these were strictly reverse engineering projects and had no
design component.
