Project
=======

You will be assigned to a group of 3 or 4 in studio and will be tasked with
modeling a relatively complex mechanical assembly of your own choosing. The
project will be part reverse engineering and part design. You will collectibely
select a product/machine/object that you think needs a design improvement.
Maybe you never want to open the lid of your trash can again and would like to
come up with an autormatic opener or your desk needs adjustable legs for
standing and sitting. The design change to improve the object should be some
simple addition, we are not asking you redesign the whole thing. You will
ultimately model something that already exists but with something additional to
improve it just a little. Ideally, all of you should have access to this thing
so that you can see it, touch it, and measure it. The majority of your work
will be to reverse engineerin:w


You will be required to submit a professional quality project report detailing
the modeling project and a team member evaluation.

Requirements
------------

Project report
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Title page with project name, team member names, studio section day, TA
  name, date, and path to the location of model and assembly drawings, e.g.,
  ``...ENG4\ENG4-205\My Documents\Project\``, use Inventor's Pack and Go
  option.
- A table of contents
- Project summary

   - Describe the assembly that was modeled
   - Describe the individual parts that were modeled
   - Who modeled which part and the assembly
   - Describe how the team accomplished the project and how well you worked
     together.

- A description of the modeling process, e.g. state the basic steps used to
  create the model.
- Difficulties you ran into (e.g. things you couldn't model, parts that took a
  long time, communication issues, team work loadetc.) and your solutions
- Improvements to the model you would like to make and additional challenges
  you would like to explore given more time

Assembly drawing of entire model assembly
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Include a parts list and label all parts
- Label drawing with all group member names

One working drawing for each modeled part
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Label drawings with group member who created the model
- Label each part with a descriptive name and number it according to the
  assembly drawing parts list

A printout of the solid model from within Inventor
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Use transparency where appropriate to show maximum detail. This may also be
  used on your title page!

The project should be handed in as a complete report with the drawings and
printout as an appendix in PDF format. Grades for the project will be done on a
group basis so be sure to proof each other's work.

Contact your TA in case they have additional requirements.

Projects are due in studio 1 hour before the end of your last studio period.
Submit your reports directly to your TA. The final hour of the last studio will
be an informal presentation to show and describe your group's model to the
class. Have your model or images of your model on a USB stick so that you can
load them onto the main computer. Each teammate should describe portions of the
model that they worked on and what the learned while doing it. This is an
informal presentation, slides are not needed and everything should be casual.
Just like a show and tell in elementary school.
