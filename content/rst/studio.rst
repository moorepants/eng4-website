Computer Lab
============

All of the students will have access to the computer lab in 1116 Academic
Surge. The lab is typically open from 8 AM to 8 PM M-Th and 8 AM to 6 PM on
Fridays. Check the schedule outside of the lab door for an up-to-date lab
schedule.

Log in to the computers with your Kerberos ID and passphrase.

Software
========

AutoDesk Inventor
-----------------

You will use `AutoDesk Inventor`_ 2013 for the majority of your studio work.
Inventor is a modern mechanical 3D parametric solid modeling software pacakge.
It offers basic solid model creation tools, automatic 2D print generation, and
many other modules for various types of engineering analysis. Proficiency in
Inventor is highly in-demand skill and  will provide the background needed to
pick up many other similar software packages.

Autodesk provides a student and educator oriented resource web site at
students.autodesk.com. Free academic versions of Inventor can be downloaded
there with a valid university email address. Check the `system requirements`_
and make sure your computer meets them before downloading and installing.
**Make sure to download the 2013 version so that the files are compatible with
the 2013 version installed in the computer lab.**

Pack and Go
~~~~~~~~~~~

Inventor uses projects (\*.ipj file) to provide a container for the many files
it generates. You will need to make use of the *Pack and Go* feature to collect
all files from a project. Follow `these instructions`_ to pack and go your
projects for submission.

Inkscape
--------

Inkscape_ is a free and open source 2D vector graphics editor based around the
Scalable Vector Graphics (\*.svg) file format. We will make use of it to draw
some basic 2D figures.

Project
=======

You will be assigned to a group in studio and will be required to submit a
design project

Requirements
------------

Project report
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Title page with project name, team member names, studio section day, TA
  name, date, and path to the location of model and assembly drawings, e.g.,
  ``...ENG4\ENG4-205\My Documents\Project\``, use Inventor's Pack and Go
  option.
- A table of contents
- Project summary

   - Describe the assembly that was modeled
   - Describe the individual parts that were modeled
   - Who modeled which part and the assembly

- A description of the modeling process, e.g. state the basic steps used to
  create the model.
- Difficulties you ran into (e.g. things you couldn't model, parts that took
  a long time, etc.) and your solutions
- Improvements to the model you would like to make and additional challenges
  you would like to explore given more time

Assembly drawing of entire model assembly
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Include a parts list and label all parts
- Label drawing with all group member names

One working drawing for each modeled part
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Label drawings with group member who created the model
- Label each part with a descriptive name and number it according to the
  assembly drawing parts list

A printout of the solid model from within Inventor
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Use transparency where appropriate to show maximum detail. This may also be
  used on your title page!

The project should be handed in as a complete report with the drawings and
printout as an appendix. Grades for the project will be done on a group basis
so be sure to proof each other's work.

Contact your TA in case they have additional requirements.

Projects are due by the end of your last Studio period. Submit your reports
directly to your TA.
