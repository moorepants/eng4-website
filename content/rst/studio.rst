Computer Lab
============

All of the students will have access to the computer lab in 1116 `Academic
Surge`_. Log in to the computers with your Kerberos ID and passphrase. The lab
is typically open from 8 AM to 8 PM M-Th and 8 AM to 6 PM on Fridays, but is
often booked for other classes. `Academic Surge`_ 1044 also has 24 computers
with the same software and more open lab time. See the `Fall 2012 schedule`_
for details or check out the schedule posted at the doors.

Software
========

Inkscape
--------

Inkscape_ is an open source and free `vector graphics`_ editor available for
most operating systems. It is very suitable for professional engineering
diagrams. It is based around the `Scalable Vector Graphics`_ (``*.svg``) format
but can also read and write to other vector formats. It can also export
drawings to bitmap/raster images. With practice highly realistic 2D images can
be created. We will learn the basics of Inkscape and create some engineering
diagrams.

Tutorials
~~~~~~~~~

The `Inkscape documentation website`_ has lots of general tutorials. We will
follow this `basic tutorial for a free body diagram`_ in the studio session.

AutoDesk Inventor
-----------------

You will use `AutoDesk Inventor`_ 2013 for the majority of your studio work.
Inventor is a modern mechanical 3D parametric solid modeling software pacakge.
It offers basic solid model creation tools, automatic 2D print generation, and
many other modules for various types of engineering analysis. Proficiency in
Inventor is highly in-demand skill and  will provide the background needed to
pick up many other similar software packages.

Autodesk provides a student and educator oriented resource web site at
http://students.autodesk.com. Free academic versions of Inventor can be
downloaded there with a valid university email address. Check the `system
requirements`_ and make sure your computer meets them before downloading and
installing\ [#mac]_. **Make sure to download the 2013 version so that the files
are compatible with the 2013 version installed in the computer lab.**

Tutorials
~~~~~~~~~

You will be using the official `Autodesk Inventor Tutorials`_ during the studio
session and also during homework. They can be viewed at the `Autodesk Help
Wiki`_ among other things.

Pack and Go
~~~~~~~~~~~

Inventor uses projects (\*.ipj file) to provide a map to the many files it
generates. You will need to make use of the *Pack and Go* feature to collect
all files from a project. Follow `these instructions`_ to pack and go your
projects for submission.

.. [#mac] Inventor is only available for Windows, but Macintosh and Linux users may
   be able to run Inventor with a virtual machine or dual booting. See this
   `Mac FAQ`_ for suggestions. Unfortunately, either solution requires you to
   have a valid copy of Windows.
