   lecture in which you will turn in by the end of the lecture.

   the book and custom problems. These are are always due in one week at the
   beginning of class.

   sessions.

Submission
==========

All assignments will be posted to the "Assignments" section on smartsite and
will allow for digital submission. Paper submission during lecture and studio
is also permitted, but if you are able to submit **all** of your assignments
digitally (sketchbook and in-class assignments excluded) and your grade is
borderline at the end of the quarter I will bump it higher at my discretion.

Digital Submissions must follow these guidelines:

- A single zip file should be attached to the assignment via smartsite. It
  should contain only pdf(s) documents and/or the results from a "Pack and Go"
  in Inventor. No word processing files are permitted (``.doc``, ``.docx``,
  ``.odt``); export to pdf if you are unsure.
- The front page of all pdf documents should include your name, the date, your
  studio section (A01, A02, A03, or A04), and the homework number.
- All digital submissions are due to smartsite before class on the due date.

Paper submissions must follow these guidelines:

- The front page should include your name, the date, your studio section (A01,
  A02, A03, or A04), and the homework number.
- Papers must be stapled.
- All paper submissions are due at the beginning of class on the due date.

You will lose points if you do not follow these submission rules.
