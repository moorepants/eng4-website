Types
=====

All of the classes assignments and due dates will be listed here. Please submit
them through smartsite Assignments tab. There are several types of assignments:

In Class Assignments
   There will be short quizzes, group activities and such assigned during the
   lecture in which you will turn in by the end of the lecture.
Lecture Homework
   Homework is assigned weekly and is typically a combination of problems from
   the book and custom problems. These are are always due in one week at the
   beginning of class.
Studio Assignments
   These assignments are given during the studio sessions and are typically due
   by the end of the studio.
Studio Homework
   The teaching assistants may periodically assign homeworks for the studio
   sessions.
Studio Project
   There will be one final group modeling and design project due the day of the
   final.

Submission
==========

All assignments will be posted to the "Assignments" section on smartsite and
will allow for digital submission. Paper submission during lecture and studio
is also permitted, but if you are able to submit **all** of your assignments
digitally (sketchbook and in-class assignments excluded) and your grade is
borderline at the end of the quarter I will bump it higher at my discretion.
You may submit part of your homework digitally and part on paper in class if
necessary but make a note in the text box in the digital submission that you
have done so.

Digital Submissions must follow these guidelines:

- A single zip file\ [#zip]_ should be attached to the assignment via
  smartsite. It should contain only pdf(s) documents, image files (``.jpg``,
  ``.png``), and/or the results from a "Pack and Go" in Inventor. No word
  processing files are permitted (``.doc``, ``.docx``, ``.odt``); export to pdf
  if you are unsure.
- The front page of all pdf documents should include your name, the date, your
  studio section (A01, A02, A03, or A04), and the homework number.
- All digital submissions are due to smartsite before class on the due date.
- Please scan hand drawings if possible. You may also take a photo of the
  drawing, but it must be clear and legible! Pulling some tips from websites_ on
  the topic may help you take a decent photograph.
- Scans and photos of the drawings should have reasonable file sizes (less than
  about 1mb per drawing). Use a low enough resolution when scanning or
  converting your images so that they aren't huge files, but high enough so
  that they remain legible and clear. The free software Gimp_ can be used to
  change the resolution like many other photo editing software. Scan in grey
  scale or black/white to reduce file size too.
