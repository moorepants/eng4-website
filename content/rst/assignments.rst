Types
=====

All of the classes assignments and due dates will be listed here. Please submit
them through smartsite Assignments tab. There are several types of assignments:

In Class Assignments
   There will be short quizzes, group activities, and such assigned during the
   lecture in which you will turn in by the end of the lecture.
Lecture Homework
   Homework is assigned weekly and is typically a combination of problems from
   the book and custom problems. These are are always due in one week at the
   beginning of class.
Studio Assignments
   These assignments are given during the studio sessions and are typically due
   by the end of the studio.
Studio Homework
   The teaching assistants may periodically assign homeworks for the studio
   sessions.
Studio Project
   There will be one final group modeling and design project due the day of the
   final.

Submission
==========

All assignments will be posted to the "Assignments" section on smartsite and
will allow for at least partial digital submission. All paper submissions are
due at the beginning of class on the due date. Papers must be stapled. All
digital submissions are due to smartsite before class on the due date.

**All hand drawn sketches must be submitted on paper in class**. This must be
the original drawing (or a photocopy if you don't want to remove it from your
sketchbook). Do not scan or photograph these and submit them digitally. If you
do, only the paper submission will actually be graded. Unless otherwise stated,
sketches and drawings may be done in your sketchbook, but you must submit a
copy of them from your sketchbook with your homework. Do not use a computer to
generate your drawings unless specified. You must include your name, the date,
your studio section (A01, A02, A03, or A04), and the homework number on all
paper submissions.

All other materials can be submitted digitally by adding them to a single zip
file\ [#zip]_ and attaching it to the assignment via smartsite. Contents of the
zip file and their file formats can include:

- Written assignments: essays, reports, etc (``.pdf``)
- Inkscape output files (``.svg``, ``.png``)
- Inventor output files (``.ipt``, ``.iam``, ``.idw``, ``.ipn``, ``.pdf``,
  ``.png``)

All written assignments must be typewritten or computer generated. Written
assignments such as essays and reports must be submitted as a *single* pdf
document for each assignment. No word processing files are permitted (``.doc``,
``.docx``, ``.odt``); export to pdf if you are unsure. These should be
formatted as a professional quality report or paper (i.e. embeded graphics,
title, author, date information, nice formatting, readable/standard fonts,
etc). The front page of all pdf documents should include your name, the date,
your studio section (A01, A02, A03, or A04), and the homework number. The
textbox in the smartsite assignment is only for notes to the instructor and/or
TAs. Do not type your essays or written work in the textbox, these should only
be submitted in a pdf.

Inkscape results should be both a ``.svg`` (save/save as) and a ``.png`` file
(export bitmap). If you use Inkscape to create the graphics for your report or
other written assignment you must embedded the graphic into the pdf file.

Inventor files must be in a self-contained folder within the single zip file.
The easiest way to guarantee that all your inventor files for a single project
are there is to use the Pack and Go option. Follow the `Pack and Go tutorial`_
do this. You can export your ``.idw`` and ``.ipn`` files as pdf documents and
also export screenshots of your models to ``.png`` format for inclusion into
reports.

If you are able to submit **all** of your assignments digitally (sketches and
in-class assignments excluded) and your grade is borderline at the end of the
quarter I will bump it higher at my discretion.

You will lose points if you do not follow these submission rules.
