**Due October 30 at beginning of lecture.**

Grading: 10 points total

Problem 4.3 (2 points)
----------------------

   In Figure 4.50, there are 12 objects swept (*revolved*) using 12 different
   profiles. Match the objects with the same profile used to create 3-D
   objects. (Hint: The profiles may not always be swept at axes perpendicular
   to each other.)

Sold Model Construction Description (2 points)
----------------------------------------------

Describe how to create a solid model of a simple coffee mug using constructive
solid geometry operations (extrusions, revolutions, sweeps, lofts, and boolean
operations). Clearly define the 2D sketch profiles used and the sweep axes
associated with each profile. This should be a series of sketches in a format
similar to that as in Figure 4.13 of the text.

Sold Model Construction Description (3 points)
----------------------------------------------

Describe how solid models can be made of each of the items in Figures 4.51 D
through F. Describe each step including all operations and primitives used.

Definitions (3 points)
----------------------

Define the following terms as they relate to the course's topics. You may use
sketches to illustrate the meaning:

- Boolean Operations
- Concurrent Design
- Contour Sketching
- Construction Line
- World Coordinate System
- Local Coordinate System
