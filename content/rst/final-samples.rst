The final will be 50%-70% graphics problems and 30%-50% short answer, multiple
choice, true/false, matching, and/or definitions. You should have read Chapters
1-11. The concepts emphasized in class and studio will be the primary material
covered, but all of the concepts from the text may also be tested. Be sure to
review the `lecture material <lectures.html>`_, your notes, studio material,
the midterm, and all assignments. You should especially be comfortable drawing
isometric drawings from multiview and vice versa, section views, auxiliary
views, construction of solid models, dimensioning, traditional tolerancing, and
the basics of GD & T. The following are representative graphics problems. Click
the image for the solution.

I will post some more practice problems over the next few days.

Dimensioning
============

For the multi-view projection shown fully dimension the drawing using the
standards and guidelines from Chapter 9. Make sure not to have any redundant
dimensions.

Section Views
=============

Complete the section view on the multiview drawing (the section view is shown
instead of the front view).

Auxiliary Views
===============

Using the front and top view of the plane ABC and point X use auxiliary views
to determine if the point lies on the plane. Show all steps.
