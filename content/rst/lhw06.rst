Problem 9.3 (4 points)
======================

(Figure 9.92 on page 536) Use the tolerancing tables in Appendixes 3-7 to
calculate the limit dimensions between the shaft and hole for the given classes
of fit.

Problem 10.4 (4 points)
=======================

Sketch or draw the two-view drawing shown in Figure 10.40. Add the geometric
dimensioning information per the following information:

1. Where the small cylinder intersects the large cylinder in the right side
   view, make the face on the larger cylinder datum feature D. Control this
   surface with a flatness tolerance of .005.
2. In the right side view, make the axis of the small cylinder datum feature E.
   The axis must be perpendicular within a .002 cylindrical tolerance zone at
   maximum material condition relative to datum feature D.
3. In the front view, make the .500-.505 slot datum feature F. Position this
   slot within a .003 tolerance zone at maximum material condition relative to
   primary datum feature D and secondary datum feature E at maximum material
   condition.
4. Make the 2.500 and 4.00 diameters basic dimensions.
5. Position the four small holes within a .005 cylindrical tolerance zone at
   maximum material condition relative to primary datum feature D, secondary
   datum feature E at maximum material condition, and tertiary datum feature F
   at maximum material
   condition.
6. Apply a profile of a surface tolerance of .050 to the outside surface in the
   front view relative to primary datum feature D and secondary datum feature E
   at maximum material condition.
