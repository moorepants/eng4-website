The midterm will be about 65-75% graphics problems and 25-35% short answer,
multiple choice, true/false, matching, and/or definitions. You should have read
Chapters 1-5. The concepts emphasized in class and studio will be the primary
material covered, but all of the concepts from the text may also be tested. Be
sure to review the `lecture material <lectures.html>`_, your notes, studio
material, and all assignments. You should especially be comfortable drawing
isometric drawings from multiview and vice versa. The following are
representative graphics problems. Click the image for the solution.

Select Correct Isometric View
=============================

For the multi-view projections shown in each lettered cell shown below (a)-(e),
select the correct corresponding isometric view in the row.

Multiview Drawing
=================

Given the isometric shown below, draw carefully by freehand the three primary
third-angle projections of the object using a grid. Be sure to darken your
lines.

Isometric Drawing
=================

Given the three multi-views of an object, draw an isometric of the object. Be
sure to darken you lines. (Hidden lines need not be shown.)
