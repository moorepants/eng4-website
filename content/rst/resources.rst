UCD 3D Modeling Club
====================

If you enjoy solid modeling and drafting, check out the 3DMD: UC Davis 3-D
Modeling and Design Club http://ucd3dmd.blogspot.com/

The 3D modeling club here at Davis is going to offer extra office hours to help
you with the Inventor software. Students will be available to answer your
questions during the office hours.

3DMD Inventor Office Hours:

| Wednesday 5-6 pm
| Thursday 6-7 pm
| Room Academic Surge 1044
|

Club Info:

3-D Modeling and Design (3DMD) is a UC Davis student club that seeks to teach
students design software, promote design, and connect students with Industry
who are involved with CAD software. Our club is most commonly known for hosting
free weekly office hours and monthly workshops on campus to teach Inventor and
other related Autodesk software to students.  The club is sponsored by
Autodesk, which essentially means free swag and pizza at major events.
Occasionally, we also have Autodesk employees come to give presentations and
workshops.

Students can also email the club with project questions or even general CAD
software questions (ucd3dmd@gmail.com).  To hear about all our events, students
are strongly encouraged to send us an email with their name to be added to our
email list, or to like us on Facebook http://www.facebook.com/ucd3dmd/.

Textbook
========

The `text book website`_ provides an online learning center with extra materials,
quizzes, and information.

Taking Notes
============

It is important to develop good note taking skills. Review `these tips`_ taken
from the Dartmouth College Academic Skills center and peruse their `informative
website`_ on the topic.

Drawing Tutorials
=================

Searching YouTube_ for any of the drawing techniques will bring up many
tutorials on the topic. For example:

- One point perspective: `Part 1 <http://youtu.be/zrYDFnaKc7s>`_, `Part 2
  <http://youtu.be/kUSBliw2gVs>`_
- Two point perspective: `Part One <http://youtu.be/KE3ZkWtX8UU>`_, `Part Two
  <http://youtu.be/WQj57V8v4pI>`_
- `Isometric <http://youtu.be/KN7281MUp_U>`_
- `Iso, Oblique, One Point, Two Point <http://youtu.be/fU8so10cXUo>`_

Zip Files
=========

`Zip files`_ can contain many other files and folders. The files inside a zip
file are also compressed to reduce overall size. If you have to turn in more
than one file for your homework you must zip them into a single file first.
Most operating systems have the ability to create zip files. Here are some
example instructions:

- Windows: http://condor.depaul.edu/slytinen/instructions/zip.html
- Mac Os X: http://www.macinstruct.com/node/159
- Ubuntu: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/FileCompression

If these instructions aren't applicable to your operating system then search
the web for instructions or download a program such as 7zip_.

Grid Paper
==========

Gridded paper is very useful for making neat sketches and drawings. You can
download a `rectangular grid`_ and `isometric grid`_ from this website or you
can print your own from http://www.printfreegraphpaper.com.

CAD Software
============

There are many CAD software packages for mechanical solid modeling. Wikipedia
has a `nice article`_ explaining computer aided design and its history. Most
packages have very similar features, but may have slightly different
implementations. I'll mention a few here, see the `list on Wikipedia` for a
complete overview. The traditional proprietary, popular, and expensive options
are:

- Catia_
- `Pro Engineer`_ (now called Creo Parametric)
- Solidworks_
- `AutoDesk Inventor`_ (free Academic version available at
  students.autodesk.com)
- SolidEdge_

There are a few open source options available, although they are not as feature
rich as many of the proprietary packages.

FreeCAD_
   Probably the most feature rich open source 3D solid modeling package.
BRL-CAD_
   A military developed 3D solid modeling package.
QCAD_
   2D CAD package.
OpenSCAD_
   Generates 3D solid models programmically.

There is also a class of `3D modeling software`_ that is used primarily by artists
and animators. These have some limitations for mechanical design and
fabrication but many are useful for engineering needs.

Sketchup_
   A 3D modeling package that is free to download. Many people make use of it
   for rapid prototyping and 3D printing.
Tinkercad_
   A web browser based 3D CAD program focused around 3D printing.
`Autodesk 123D`_
   Autodesk's simple 3D CAD program that can be used to create objects for 3D
   printing. Print at home or have them print for you.
Blender_
   A free and open source 3D modeling, animation, and rendering package. There
   is a `module for engineering style CAD`_ in the works.
