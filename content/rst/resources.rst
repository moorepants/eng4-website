Textbook
========

The `text book website`_ provides an online learning center with extra materials,
quizzes, and information.

Taking Notes
============

It is important to develop good note taking skills. Review `these tips`_ taken
from the Dartmouth College Academic Skills center and peruse their `informative
website`_ on the topic.

Grid Paper
==========

Gridded paper is very useful for making neat sketches and drawings. You can
download a `rectangular grid`_ and `isometric grid`_ from this website or you
can print your own from http://www.printfreegraphpaper.com.

CAD Software
============

There are many CAD software packages for mechanical solid modeling. Wikipedia
has a `nice article`_ explaining computer aided design and its history. Most
packages have very similar features, but may have slightly different
implementations. I'll mention a few here, see the `list on Wikipedia` for a
complete overview. The traditional proprietary, popular, and expensive options
are:

- Catia_
- `Pro Engineer`_ (now called Creo Parametric)
- Solidworks_
- `AutoDesk Inventor`_ (free Academic version available at
  students.autodesk.com)
- SolidEdge_

There are a few open source options available, although they are not as feature
rich as many of the proprietary packages.

FreeCAD_
   Probably the most feature rich open source 3D solid modeling package.
BRL-CAD_
   A military developed 3D solid modeling package.
QCAD_
   2D CAD package.
OpenSCAD_
   Generates 3D solid models programmically.

There is also a class of `3D modeling software`_ that is used primarily by artists
and animators. These have some limitations for mechanical design and
fabrication but many are useful for engineering needs.

Sketchup_
   A 3D modeling package that is free to download. Many people make use of it
   for rapid prototyping and 3D printing.
Blender_
   A free and open source 3D modeling, animation, and rendering package. There
   is a `module for engineering style CAD`_ in the works.
