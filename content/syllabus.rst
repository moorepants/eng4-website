Course Description
==================

| University of California, Davis
| Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering
| Engineering Graphics Design - ENG 004
| Fall 2012
|

Lecture 2 hours; laboratory 3 hours. Engineering design, descriptive geometry,
pictorial sketching, computer-aided graphics, and their application in the
solution of engineering problems.

This course is an introduction to engineering design and the related graphical
tools used to communicate design concepts. Topics include the following: visual
thinking, engineering design, free-hand sketching, projection theory, pictorial
sketching, solid modeling, engineering drawing standards, tolerancing,
plotting, and computer-aided design.

This course is designed to address three of the Mechanical and Aerospace
Engineering student outcomes:

- to prepare you to design a system, component, or process to meet desired
  needs within realistic constraints such as economic, environmental, social,
  political, ethical, health and safety, manufacturability, and sustainability;
- to prepare you to communicate effectively;
- to prepare you to use the techniques, skills, and modern engineering tools
  necessary for engineering practice.

You are required to keep a design notebook (unlined sketchpad) for this course.
Details on its use will be discussed in the first studio (lab) session. It will
be collected a few times during the quarter and graded on consistent use and
not on quality alone. Please number, date, and initial each page entry.
